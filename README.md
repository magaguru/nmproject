##  How It Works

1. Product data is stored in a database.
2. The frontend calls an API to fetch product data.
3. When a user applies filters or search terms, the frontend sends these parameters to the backend.
4. The backend queries the database and returns filtered results.
5. The frontend updates the product list dynamically.
